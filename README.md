###  System Configuration (ros_gz_bridge)
The `ros_gz_bridge` acts as the vital communication layer, translating messages between the Gazebo transport layer and the ROS 2 DDS middleware.

| Topic | Gazebo Type | ROS 2 Type | Direction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/scan` | `gz.msgs.LaserScan` | `sensor_msgs/LaserScan` | GZ → ROS 2 |
| `/odom` | `gz.msgs.Odometry` | `nav_msgs/Odometry` | GZ → ROS 2 |
| `/cmd_vel` | `gz.msgs.Twist` | `geometry_msgs/Twist` | ROS 2 → GZ |

**Issues Resolved:**
1. **Sensor Activation:** Modified `simple_maze.world` to include the `gz::sim::systems::Sensors` plugin, which was missing in the skeleton, ensuring LiDAR data generation.
2. **Namespace Mapping:** Implemented remapping logic to bridge the robot's hardware interface with our custom planner node effectively.

###  Potential Field Navigation Algorithm

</p>

#### 1. The Mathematical Model
The navigation logic is based on an  Potential Field Methods (PFM), where the robot moves according to the resultant vector of attractive and repulsive forces.

* **Attractive Force ($F_{att}$):** Generates a pull toward the goal coordinates.
    $$F_{att} = k_{att} \times (P_{goal} - P_{robot})$$
* **Repulsive Force ($F_{rep}$):** Generates a push away from obstacles detected by LiDAR.
    $$F_{rep} = k_{rep} \times \left(\frac{1}{d} - \frac{1}{d_{obs}}\right) \times \frac{1}{d^2}$$
    *(Where $d$ is the current distance to an obstacle and $d_{obs}$ is the influence threshold).*

#### 2. Handling LiDAR Data
To ensure numerical stability and prevent system crashes, a robust filtering pipeline was implemented:
* **Zeros & NaNs:** Automatically discarded to avoid division-by-zero errors in the force calculations.
* **Infs:** Treated as the maximum sensor range (5.0m), representing clear paths for navigation.

#### 3. Escape Strategy (Local Minima)

</p>
In the **Complex Maze**, standard APF often gets stuck in U-shaped traps. We implemented **Virtual Charges**:
* The robot maintains a `path_history` of its previous coordinates.
* When a stall is detected, these coordinates act as temporary "repulsive charges," pushing the robot out of dead-ends and forcing it to explore new paths toward the goal.

### Parameter Tuning
After multiple iterations in the Gazebo environment, we settled on the following gains to balance speed and safety:

| Parameter | Symbol | Simple Maze | Complex Maze | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Attractive Gain | $k_{att}$ | 1.2 | 0.4 | Controls the approach velocity to the goal |
| Repulsive Gain | $k_{rep}$ | 1.0 | 4.5 | Determines the strength of obstacle avoidance |
| Influence Dist. | $d_{obs}$ | 1.5 m | 1.5 m | Sets the safety buffer radius around walls |
| Memory Gain | $k_{mem}$ | 0.0 | 3.0 | Strength of spatial memory to avoid traps |
| Goal Tolerance | $d_{goal}$ | 0.2 m | 0.2 m | Defines the arrival radius for a successful stop |

### 1.3 Package Installation

To establish a functional development environment for the **TurtleBot4**, we utilized the following workflow:

* **Repository Cloning:** We cloned the official TurtleBot4 repositories (core, simulator, and desktop utilities) directly into the `ros2_project_ws/src` directory, specifically targeting the **jazzy** branch.
* **Dependency Resolution:** By executing `rosdep`, we ensured that all system-level dependencies (such as Navigation2 and Gazebo bridge libraries) were correctly identified and installed.
* **Efficient Compilation:** The workspace was built using `colcon build --symlink-install`. This flag is a development best practice, as it creates symbolic links instead of copying files, allowing our Python-based **Potential Field Planner** scripts to reflect changes immediately without requiring a full re-compilation.
